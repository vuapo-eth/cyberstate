# Idea

- A giant DAO.
- People can vote on-chain.
- Everything should be completely open source, nobody controls it.
- The President and all positions are enforced by smart contracts.
- There is a token that acts as currency and the token emission (“central bank”) is encoded in smart contracts.
- We finance the development by selling government debt to investors. Later on, once internationally recognized, investors are paid back from the taxes.
